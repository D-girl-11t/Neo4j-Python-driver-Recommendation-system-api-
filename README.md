Neo4j Python Drivers

There are 3 methods:
 - Neo4j official driver
 - Using py2neo library
 - neo4j Restclient method
 
 Driver API concept:
   - Driver : creates sessions
   - Session : Logical Context for Database interaction
   - Transaction : Logical unit of work
   - Statement Result : Stream of records and metadata
   
   
I am going to use Neo4j graph Database with python official driver in order to map http requests to python functions of Content and Collaborative Filtering using Flask api.
